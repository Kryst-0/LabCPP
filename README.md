# LabCPP
The worst c++ compiler ever made

note: you have to put the c++ file in a folder with the same name of the file (max 8 characters), the run the script and the exe will be in the folder where you put the c++ file

PS: the 8 characters thing is a lie (just like the cake)

Update: I'm working to integrate this thing on vscode, wish me luck
